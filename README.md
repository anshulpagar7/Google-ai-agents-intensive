🤖 Google × Kaggle — 5-Day AI Agents Intensive
My Learning Journey Building Real-World Autonomous AI Agents

This repository contains my complete work, notes, and hands-on notebooks from the Google × Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course.
Across these 5 days, I’m learning to build production-grade AI agents using:

Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Gemini 2.5 models

Custom tools

Multi-agent orchestration

Real-world workflows (sequential, parallel, looped)

Tool delegation, code execution, and more

📆 Progress Overview
✅ Day 1 – Introduction to Agents

Learned the foundations of agentic AI:

What agents are (Model + Tools + Orchestration)

The Think → Act → Observe loop

Built my first Gemini-powered agent using ADK

Used Google Search as a tool

Explored the ADK Web Interface

Built multi-agent systems:

Research + Summary orchestration

Sequential workflows

Parallel workflows

Loop-based refinement workflows

✅ Day 2 – Agent Tools & Custom Logic

Learned how to give agents real capabilities beyond LLM reasoning:

🔧 Custom Function Tools

Converted Python functions into ADK tools:

get_fee_for_payment_method()

get_exchange_rate()

🤖 Agent Tools

Built agents that use other agents as callable tools.

🧮 Built-In Code Executor

Created a calculation agent that:

Generates Python code

Executes it safely

Produces accurate math results

💱 Enhanced Currency Converter Agent

A full AI workflow:

Looks up fees

Looks up exchange rates

Delegates math to a Calculation Agent

Produces a fully explained financial breakdown

🎯 What’s Coming Next

Day 2B: Tool patterns + error fallback

Day 3: Memory, sessions & context handling

Day 4: Multi-agent collaboration at scale

Day 5: Final capstone agent

🌟 Goal

By the end of this course, I’ll have built end-to-end autonomous agents capable of reasoning, tool use, delegation, and real-world action — ready for production-level AI projects.
