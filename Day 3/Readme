# Day 3 – Memory Management (Sessions & Context)

## Covered Topics
- Stateless nature of LLMs and why memory is needed
- Session and Event-based conversation management
- InMemorySessionService vs DatabaseSessionService
- Persistent conversations using SQLite
- Context Compaction for long conversations
- Session State management using custom tools

## Key Concepts Learned
- Sessions store conversation history as Events
- Persistent sessions survive restarts and crashes
- Context compaction reduces token usage and cost
- Session state allows structured memory (e.g., user name, country)
- Sessions are isolated but can share user-scoped state

## Practical Outcomes
- Built a stateful chatbot that remembers user details
- Implemented database-backed memory
- Verified automatic context summarization
- Managed session state using ToolContext
