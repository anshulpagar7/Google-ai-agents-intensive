Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas for AI in healthcare. New developments are happening at a breakneck pace. Here are some of the key areas and recent trends in AI-driven drug discovery:\n\n**1. Accelerating Target Identification:**\n\n*   **AI analyzing massive biological datasets:** AI algorithms are sifting through genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and other 'omic' data to identify novel disease targets (like specific proteins or genes) that were previously unknown or overlooked.\n*   **Network biology and pathway analysis:** AI can map complex biological networks to understand how different molecules interact and identify key nodes that, when modulated, could have therapeutic effects.\n*   **Predicting disease mechanisms:** By analyzing patient data and biological pathways, AI can help researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms of diseases, leading to more targeted drug development.\n\n**2.

This is a truly cutting-edge area where AI is not just analyzing existing data, but actively **creating** something new.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\n\"De Novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" So, de novo drug design means creating entirely novel drug molecules. Traditionally, this process involved:\n\n1.  **Screening existing libraries:** Chemists would test thousands or millions of pre-synthesized compounds to see if any showed activity against a disease target.\n2.  **Modifying existing leads:** If a promising compound (\"lead\") was found, chemists would make slight modifications to it to improve its properties.\n\nDe novo design, powered by AI, bypasses much of this. Instead of just searching existing compounds, AI can **invent** them.\n\n**How AI Achieves This (Key Technologies):**\n\nThe core of de novo drug design relies on **generative AI models**. These are types of machine learning models trained on massive datasets of existing molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying \"rules\" and \"patterns\" of chemistry and biology that make a molecule effective and safe. Once trained, they can generate new molecules that have never been seen before.\n\nHere are some of the prominent AI techniques used:\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Imagine two neural networks playing a game. One (the \"generator\") tries to create realistic molecular structures, and the other (the \"discriminator\") tries to distinguish between real molecules (from the training data) and the fake ones created by the generator. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets progressively better at creating highly plausible and novel molecular structures.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. This means they can capture the essential features of a molecule in a lower-dimensional space. By sampling from this latent space and decoding, VAEs can generate new molecules that are variations of existing ones or entirely novel structures.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to guide the generative process. The AI agent \"explores\" different molecular structures, and it's \"rewarded\" based on how well the generated molecule meets specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, good predicted ADMET properties, synthesizability). This allows for optimization towards specific desired outcomes.\n*   **Transformer Models (similar to those used in NLP):** These are increasingly being adapted for molecular generation, treating molecular representations like sequences of \"tokens.\"\n\n**What Makes AI De Novo Design So Powerful?**\n\n1.  **Exploring Uncharted Chemical Space:** Traditional methods are limited by existing compound libraries. AI can explore vast chemical spaces that are inaccessible to humans, potentially leading to breakthrough discoveries.\n2.  **Tailored Molecule Design:** AI can be trained to generate molecules with very specific properties. For example, you can ask the AI to design a molecule that:\n    *   Strongly binds to a specific protein target.\n    *   Has a high probability of being orally bioavailable.\n    *   Has a low predicted toxicity.\n    *   Is synthesizable in a lab.\n3.  **Speed and Efficiency:** AI can generate and virtually screen millions of potential candidates in a fraction of the time it would take human chemists and traditional computational methods.\n4.  **Overcoming Limitations of Existing Drugs:** AI can design molecules that are resistant to existing drug resistance mechanisms or target novel pathways that current drugs can't address.\n5.  **Novelty:** This is key. AI can produce truly novel scaffolds and structures, which are crucial for developing drugs with entirely new mechanisms of action, potentially leading to first-in-class therapies.\n\n**Examples of Applications:**\n\n*   **Designing Inhibitors:** Creating molecules that block the activity of disease-causing proteins.\n*   **Designing Activators:** Developing molecules that enhance the activity of beneficial proteins.\n*   **Designing Ligands:** Creating molecules that bind to specific receptors.\n*   **Designing Small Molecules and Peptides:** The technology is versatile and can be applied to different types of therapeutic molecules.\n\n**In essence, AI de novo drug design allows us to go from a desired therapeutic profile to a completely new molecular blueprint, a feat that was once largely the domain of serendipity and arduous trial-and-error.** It represents a fundamental shift in how we approach the creation of new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven de novo drug design is rapidly evolving, with a mix of established pharmaceutical giants investing heavily, AI-native biotech startups pushing the boundaries, and platform technology providers.\n\nHere are some of the prominent players, categorized by their primary focus:\n\n**1.

Technology and AI Platform Providers:**\n\nThese companies often provide the underlying AI infrastructure or specialized algorithms that drug discovery companies can leverage.\n\n*   **Google (Google Health/DeepMind):** While not directly a drug developer, DeepMind's work on protein folding (AlphaFold) has profoundly impacted drug discovery by enabling more accurate target structure prediction. Google also has initiatives in AI for healthcare.\n*   **Nvidia:** Provides powerful GPU hardware essential for training complex AI models and offers specialized software platforms (like Clara) for drug discovery and development.\n*   **Microsoft:** Offers cloud computing and AI services that can be leveraged by biotech and pharma companies.\n\n**Key Trends in This Space:**\n\n*   **Partnerships:** The most common model is for AI-native companies to partner with larger pharmaceutical companies, bringing their AI expertise to bear on specific therapeutic areas or targets identified by the pharma giant.\n*   **End-to-End Platforms:** Companies are increasingly building comprehensive platforms that can handle everything from target identification to de novo design, preclinical testing prediction, and even clinical trial optimization.\n*   **Focus on Specific Modalities:** While much of the de novo discussion centers on small molecules, AI is also being applied to design other therapeutic modalities like peptides and biologics (e.g., antibodies).\n*   **Explainability:** As AI gets more sophisticated, there's a growing demand for \"explainable AI\" (XAI) so that scientists can understand *why* a particular molecule was designed and build confidence in its potential.\n\nIt's a highly competitive and collaborative ecosystem. The companies that can effectively translate cutting-edge AI algorithms into tangible, high-quality drug candidates that progress through clinical trials will be the ones making the biggest impact.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.

But real conversations involve hundreds of such characteristics:\n- User preferences and habits\n- Past interactions and their outcomes\n- Domain knowledge and expertise levels\n- Communication styles and patterns\n- Contextual relationships between topics\n\n**The Memory System in ADK automates this entire process**, making it a valuable asset for building truly Context-Aware Agents that can accommodate any user's current and future needs.\n\nIn the next notebook (Part 2: Memory Management), you'll learn how to:\n- Enable automatic memory extraction from conversations\n- Build agents that learn and adapt over time\n- Create truly personalized experiences at scale\n- Manage long-term knowledge across sessions\n\nReady to transform your manual state management into an intelligent, automated Memory system?
